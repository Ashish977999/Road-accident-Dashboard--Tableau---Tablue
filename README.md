Road Accident Dashboard: Analyzing Casualties Based on Weather Conditions and Road Surfaces
Project Description
This project involves creating an interactive road accident dashboard using Tableau. The goal is to visualize and analyze road casualties based on weather conditions and road surface types using a dummy dataset. The dashboard allows users to interact with data to explore how different weather and road conditions influence accident rates.

The dashboard uses various charts, graphs, and filters to provide insights into accident trends, helping traffic analysts, policymakers, and road safety professionals make data-driven decisions.
